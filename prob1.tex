Direct Proof

Prove that all groups of order strictly less than $6$ are abelian.

\begin{solution}
As given by Lagrange's theorem, we know that for $H$ to be a subgroup of $G$, where both $H$ and $G$ are finite groups, the order of $H$ must divide the order of $G$. Let $g\in G, g \neq e$ where $e$ is the identity element. Assume $|G| = p$ where $p$ is a prime number $p \neq 1$. Now let us denote the cyclic group generated by $g$ as $\langle g \rangle$. Since $g$ is within the group $G$, $\langle g \rangle$ must be a subgroup of $G$ in order for $G$ to be closed under a binary operation. INSERT LAGRANGE We therefore know that $|\langle g \rangle|$ must divide $|G|$ by Lagrange's theorem. Since the order of $G$ is a prime number we know that the only divisors of $p$ are $p$ and 1. Since we said that $ g \neq e$, then $|\langle g \rangle|$ is not equal to one, it must be true that $|\langle g \rangle| = p$ and $\langle g \rangle \ = G$. We can then conclude that if the order of $G$ is prime and not equal to one, then $G$ is cyclic and therefore is abelian. This shows that groups of order 2,3,5 are all abelian. If $G$ has order 1, then by the definition of a group, it only contains the identity element $e$ and is therefore abelian. 


Now when we look at the case where $|G| = 4$, there are several possible groups we could create of order 4. The first scenario is when $G$ contains an element of order 4, $\{ e, x, x^2, x^3 \}$ meaning that $G$ is cyclic and therefore abelian. The next scenario arises if $G$ contains an element of order 3, $\{ e, x, x^2, y \}$, however, since the elements $xy, yx, x^2y, yx^2$ are not within the set, the group is not closed and therefore is not valid. Lastly, $G$ can be comprised of 3 elements of order 2, $\{ e, x, y, z \}$. Let us define $xy$ to be equal to $z$ so we may rewrite the set at $\{ e, x, y, xy \}$. If every element has order 2, then we can see that $x^2 = y^2 = (xy)^2 = e$. In order to show that this particular group is abelian, then we must show that $xy = yx$ and we can do so as follows

$$(xy)^2  = e = x^2y^2$$
$$ xyxy=xxyy$$
$$ xxyxy =xxxyy$$
$$ eyxy = exyy$$
$$ yxy = xyy$$
$$ yxyy = xyyy$$
$$ yxe = xye$$
$$yx = xy $$
Therefore showing that the group is abelian. We have then shown that all possible groups of order 4 are either abelian or cannot exist so we can conclude that all groups of order 4 are abelian.

Since we have shown that sets of order 1,2,3,4, and 5 are all abelian we have thus shown that every group of order strictly less than $6$ is abelian as desired.
