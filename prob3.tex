Proof by Contradiction

Let $A\leq S_4$ be defined by \[A=\{(1),(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23),(123),(132),(124),(142),(134),(143),(234),(243)\}.\]  You do not need to prove that this is a subgroup (but you should anyway for your own benefit).  Prove that $A$ has no subgroup of order $6$.   

\begin{proof}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $A_4$ such that $|H| = 6$. $A_4$ contains the identity element, 3 cycles of order 2, and 8 cycles of order 3. By the pigeonhole principle, at LEAST 2 cycles of order 3 cannot be within $H$. Let us denote these two cycles as $x$ and $y$. By Lagrange's theorem, we define the index of a subgroup to be the number of left/right cosets and can calculate the index by diving the order of the groups. So we can derive that the index of $H$ is $[A_4 : H] = 2$. We know that there are 2 distinct cosets, however we know that one of these cosets must be $H$ so we are left with one coset not equal to $H$. Now let us proceed to look at the cosets generated by $x$ and $y$. 

When looking at possible cycles for $x$ and $y$, we again arrive at two distinct possibilities, either that $(x^2 = y \text{ and } x = y^2)$ or $(x^2 \neq y \text{ and } x \neq y^2)$. Let us look at the first possibility of where $(x^2 = y \text{ and } x = y^2)$. Since $x,y \not\in H$, then $xH \neq H$ and $yH \neq H$. Since we stated that there is only 1 coset not equal to $H$, it follows that $xH = yH = x^2H$. However, if we multiply both sides by $x$, we get $x^2H = xyH = x^3H$. By definition, $x$ is a 3-cycle meaning that $x^3 = e$ so we can reduce our statement to be that $x^2H = eH = H$ so $x^2H = yH = H$ which is a contradiction as we said that $x$ and $y$ are not in $H$.

Let us now look at the other case where $(x^2 \neq y \text{ and } x \neq y^2)$. Similarly, we see that $xH \neq H$ and $yH \neq H$. Since we know that $x \not\in H$  and $xH \neq H$. $x^2H$ must be equal to either $H$ or $xH$. If $x^2H = H$, then since $x$ is a 3-cycle $x^2 = x^{-1}$ and $x^{-1}\in H$ but in order to fufil the properties of a group, if $x^{-1}\in H$ then $x\in H$ as well which is a contradiction since we stated that $x\not\in H$. If $x^2H \neq H$ then $x^2H = xH$, and by multiplying both sides by $x$, we get that $x^3H = x^2H \rightarrow eH = x^2H \rightarrow H = x^2H$ which is a contradiction since we stated that $x^2H \neq H$.

Therefore, we can see that it is impossible for $H$ to be a subgroup of $A_4$ meaning that it is impossible for $A_4$ to have a subgroup of order 6.
