If and only if

Let $G$ be a group.  Prove that $G$ is abelian if and only if $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in G$. 

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $G$ is an abelian group. Let $a,b,c \in G$ and let $c = ab$. Then $cc = c^2$. Now we can substitute in $ab$ for $c$.
$$(ab)(c) = (ab)^2 $$ Since we know $G$ is abelian, then we can rewrite $c$ as $ba$ giving us $$(ab)(ba) = (ab)^2 $$ $$ab^2a = (ab)^2$$ $$ aab^2 = (ab)^2$$ $$a^2b^2 = (ab)^2$$ Therefore showing that $G$ is abelian implies $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in G$.

Now suppose we know that $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ is true for all $a,b\in G$. Lets show that $G$ is abelian.
$$ (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 $$
$$(ab)(ab) = aabb $$
$$abab = aabb $$ Multiply both sides by $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$
$$a^{-1}abab b^{-1} = a^{-1}aabb b^{-1}$$
$$ ba = ab$$
Which is the definition of commutative meaning that $G$ is abelian if and only if $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in G$.
